# Radar_STOP-GO
Rotary radar that changes an RGB LED (green → red) depending on the distance measured and that also has its distance displayed on an LCD display. Upon reaching the distance wanted (in this case 15 cm) or less, the servo stops, and, apart from having the RGB light changed, the LCD display goes from having "Mi dist es: >15" (My distance is : >15) to "Mi dist es : X" (X being the distance where the thing was found).

Components used:
-ELEGOO UNO R3
-LCD Display
-HC-SR04 sensor
